            <h2>Storytelling</h2>
            The left plot shows the GDP in US dollars/capita for certain European countries in 2016 compared to it's population.
            An odd sight is when the population of an European country is higher than 15 million, there seems to be a positive correlation
            between population and GDP per capita, while there seems to be absolute no correlation when the population is below the 15 million,
            given by an imaginary linear regression that seems to be vertical when pruning countries with a population higher than 15 million.
            Another subject given the GDP is; does having a higher income equals a better quality of life? By using the Quality of Life index from numbeo,
            a bar chart is visualized for each country. By clicking on a scatter, the barchart will be updated to it's respective country.

            <h2>Design choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Plotted the GDP data in a scatter plot, so there is a distinction between each country.</li>
                <li>Size of the scatters are based on total GDP, just for esthetics. It basically shows how rich the country is as an union.</li>
                <li>To view the Quality of Life index of a certain country, just simply click on a scatter, and the barchart will be updated
                    to the given country. This way the site will only see the data that is relevant to the viewer.</li>
